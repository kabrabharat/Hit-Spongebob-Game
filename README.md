# Hit-Spongebob-Game

Its an android game, made using a cartoon character name "spongebob" image. In this game, I used the random class (utility) so that the sponge bob image appear randomly anywhere on the screen, you need to tab on the spongebob image to gain score. On the top left corner a countdown of 15 seconds will start as you push the play button(which is at the bottom) and on the top right corner it'll show the High Score of the game.
